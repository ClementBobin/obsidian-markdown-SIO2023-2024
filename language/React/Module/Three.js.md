## Three.js Style Sheet

### Installation

1. Install Three.js and React Three Fiber packages via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install three @react-three/fiber
```

The `three` package provides the core Three.js library, and `@react-three/fiber` is a React renderer for Three.js that simplifies integration with React components.

2. Import required components and hooks in your React component:

```jsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'; 
import { OrbitControls, PerspectiveCamera, Box } from '@react-three/drei';
```

The `Canvas` component from `@react-three/fiber` provides the Three.js scene setup and rendering for React components. The `OrbitControls`, `PerspectiveCamera`, and `Box` are commonly used components from `@react-three/drei` for camera controls, camera setup, and 3D object creation, respectively.

### Basic Scene Setup

```jsx
function ThreeJSComponent() {   
	return (     
		<Canvas>       
			<PerspectiveCamera position={[0, 0, 5]} />       
			<ambientLight intensity={0.5} />       
			<pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />       
			{/* Add 3D objects and components here */}     
		</Canvas>   
	); 
}
```

The `Canvas` component sets up the Three.js scene and handles rendering. The `PerspectiveCamera` component defines the camera's position in 3D space. The `ambientLight` and `pointLight` components add lighting to the scene.

### Adding 3D Objects

#### Box

```jsx
<Box args={[1, 1, 1]} position={[0, 0, 0]} />
```

The `Box` component creates a 3D box with the specified dimensions (width, height, and depth) and position.

#### Sphere

```jsx
<mesh>   
	<sphereGeometry args={[1, 32, 32]} />   
	<meshStandardMaterial color="blue" /> 
</mesh>
```

The `<mesh>` component groups a 3D object's geometry and material. The `sphereGeometry` defines the sphere's size and resolution, and `meshStandardMaterial` sets the object's material properties, such as color.

### Camera and Controls

```jsx
function ThreeJSComponent() {   
	return (     
		<Canvas>       
			<PerspectiveCamera position={[0, 0, 5]} />       
			<OrbitControls />       
			{/* ... */}     
		</Canvas>   
	); 
}
```

The `PerspectiveCamera` defines the camera's position and perspective within the 3D scene. The `OrbitControls` component allows users to interactively control the camera's position and rotation.

### Styling 3D Objects

```jsx
<mesh>   
	<boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />   
	<meshStandardMaterial color="blue" /> 
</mesh>
```

The `<mesh>` component groups a 3D object's geometry and material. The `boxGeometry` defines the box's dimensions, and `meshStandardMaterial` sets the object's material properties, such as color.

### Animations

```jsx
<mesh rotation={[0, time * 0.2, 0]}>   
	<boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />   
	<meshStandardMaterial color="blue" /> 
</mesh>
```

The `rotation` property animates the rotation of the 3D object. `time` is a variable that provides the current timestamp, allowing smooth animations based on time.

### Textures

```jsx
<mesh>   
	<boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />   
	<meshStandardMaterial map={texture} /> 
</mesh>
```

The `meshStandardMaterial` component accepts a `map` property, which allows you to apply a texture to the 3D object. The `texture` variable would be a loaded texture image.
