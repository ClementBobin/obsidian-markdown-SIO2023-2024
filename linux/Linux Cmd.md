# Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) and Commands  
## Introduction  
The Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with the Linux operating system using text-based commands. It offers great flexibility, efficiency, and automation capabilities, making it an essential skill for developers, system administrators, and power users.  
## Basic Commands  
### 1. **`ls` - List Files and Directories**  
```bash 
ls [options] [directory]
```

- `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- `ls -l`: Detailed listing showing permissions, ownership, size, and modification time.
- `ls -a`: Lists all files, including hidden ones.

### 2. **`cd` - Change Directory**

```bash
cd [directory]
```

- `cd`: Changes to the home directory.
- `cd ..`: Moves up one directory.
- `cd /path/to/directory`: Changes to a specific directory.

### 3. **`mkdir` - Make Directory**

```bash
mkdir [directory_name]
```

- Creates a new directory with the specified name.

### 4. **`touch` - Create Empty File**

```bash
touch [filename]
```

- Creates a new empty file with the specified name.

### 5. **`rm` - Remove**

```bash
rm [options] [filename]
```

- `rm filename`: Removes a file.
- `rm -r directory`: Removes a directory and its contents recursively.

## File Manipulation

### 1. **`cp` - Copy**

```bash
cp [options] [source] [destination]
```

- `cp file1 file2`: Copies file1 to file2.
- `cp -r dir1 dir2`: Copies dir1 to dir2 recursively.

### 2. **`mv` - Move**

```bash
mv [options] [source] [destination]
```

- `mv file1 file2`: Renames file1 to file2.
- `mv file1 dir`: Moves file1 to the directory.

## System Information

### 1. **`uname` - Print System Information**

bashCopy code

`uname [options]`

- `uname -a`: Prints all system information.
- `uname -r`: Prints the kernel release.

### 2. **`df` - Display Free Disk Space**

```bash
df [options]
```

- `df -h`: Displays disk space in human-readable format.

### 3. **`top` - Display System Processes**

```bash
top
```

- Displays real-time information about system processes, memory usage, etc.

## Text Processing

### 1. **`cat` - Concatenate and Display**

```bash
cat [filename]
```

- Displays the contents of a file.

### 2. **`grep` - Search Text**

```bash
grep [options] [pattern] [filename]
```

- `grep pattern file`: Searches for a pattern in a file.

### 3. **`sed` - Stream Editor**

```bash
sed [options] 's/old/new/g' [filename]
```

- `sed 's/old/new/g' file`: Replaces occurrences of 'old' with 'new'.

## Network Commands  
### `tracepath` Command - Tracing the Network Path

The `tracepath` command in Linux is used to trace the network path to a given host (a domain name or an IP address). It helps in understanding the route or path that network packets take to reach the specified destination.

#### Usage:

```bash
tracepath [options] [hostname/IP]
```

#### Example:

```bash
tracepath google.com
```

In this example, we're tracing the network path to Google's servers.

#### Response Explanation:

When you execute `tracepath`, it displays a list of all the hops (intermediate devices or nodes) between your local system and the destination (e.g., google.com). Each hop is represented by an IP address.

For each hop, it typically shows:

- **IP Address**: The IP address of the hop.
- **Hostname**: If possible, the hostname corresponding to the IP address (if the DNS resolves it).
- **RTT (Round-Trip Time)**: The round-trip time or latency in milliseconds for a packet to reach that hop and return.

Here's a sample output:

 ```bash
1?: [LOCALHOST]                       pmtu 1500

Too many hops: pmtu 1500      
Resume: pmtu 1500
``` 

In this output:

- Each line represents a hop.
- The IP addresses and hostnames (if available) show the devices or nodes along the path.
- The round-trip time (RTT) represents the time taken for a packet to reach that hop and return.

The output also shows "no reply" for some hops. This can happen if the hop doesn't respond to the trace request.

`tracepath` is valuable for diagnosing network issues, understanding the route to a specific destination, and identifying latency at different hops.

In the context of `tracepath` output, "asymm" stands for "asymmetric." It's used to indicate that there is asymmetry in the round-trip time (RTT) for packets traveling to a specific hop.

In networking, symmetry refers to equality or similarity in characteristics or properties. When discussing network latency or round-trip time, symmetry implies that the time it takes for a packet to reach a destination and return (RTT) is consistent or equal in both directions.

However, in real-world network scenarios, especially on the internet, network paths can be asymmetrical. This means that the RTT from your local system to a certain hop might be different from the RTT when returning from that hop back to your local system.

When `tracepath` shows "asymm" followed by a hop number and RTT, it's indicating that the RTT for reaching that hop and the RTT for returning from that hop are not the same or are asymmetric. This could be due to various factors, such as differing network congestion, routing decisions, or other network conditions.

Understanding asymmetry in network paths is important for diagnosing network performance issues and optimizing the network for better efficiency.
