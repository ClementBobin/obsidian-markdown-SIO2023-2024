# Hyperland in Linux

Hyperland is a tiling window manager for Linux, designed to provide a customizable and efficient window management experience. This guide will help you get started with Hyperland, similar to how you would configure Qtile.

## Installation

You can install Hyperland on your Linux system using the following command, assuming your package manager supports it.

bashCopy code

`sudo apt-get install hyperland   # For Debian/Ubuntu sudo pacman -S hyperland         # For Arch Linux`

## Getting Started

1. **Configuration File**: Create a configuration file for Hyperland. The configuration file is usually located at `~/.config/hyperland/config.py`. You can copy the default configuration file to get started.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cp /usr/share/hyperland/config.py ~/.config/hyperland/`
    
2. **Edit Configuration**: Open the configuration file in a text editor and customize it to your liking. This is where you define keybindings, layout settings, and other preferences.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `nano ~/.config/hyperland/config.py`
    
3. **Keybindings**: Define keybindings for common window management tasks like moving, resizing, and launching applications. Here's an example:
    
    pythonCopy code
    
    `from libqtile.config import Key from libqtile.command import lazy  mod = "mod4"  # Use the Windows key as the modifier  keys = [     Key([mod], "j", lazy.layout.down()),     Key([mod], "k", lazy.layout.up()),     Key([mod, "shift"], "j", lazy.layout.shuffle_down()),     Key([mod, "shift"], "k", lazy.layout.shuffle_up()),     Key([mod], "Return", lazy.layout.swap_main()),     Key([mod], "Tab", lazy.next_layout()),     Key([mod], "w", lazy.window.kill()),     Key([mod], "r", lazy.spawn("dmenu_run")), ]`
    
4. **Autostart Applications**: You can add applications to auto-start with Hyperland by modifying the `autostart` section in the configuration file. For example:
    
    pythonCopy code
    
    `autostart = [     "compton",     "nm-applet",     "blueman-applet", ]`
    
5. **Appearance**: Customize the appearance of Hyperland by defining your preferred colors, fonts, and widgets.
    
6. **Restart Hyperland**: After making changes to the configuration file, restart Hyperland to apply your settings.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `hyperland -c ~/.config/hyperland/config.py`
    
7. **Enjoy Tiling**: Start enjoying the tiling window management experience that Hyperland provides. Use your defined keybindings to navigate and manage windows efficiently.
