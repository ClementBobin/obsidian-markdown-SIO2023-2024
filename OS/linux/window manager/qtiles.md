# Qtile: A Tiling Window Manager for X11

Qtile is a dynamic tiling window manager designed for X11, which means it arranges application windows in a non-overlapping layout. It's written and configured in Python, making it highly customizable and extensible.

## Key Features

- **Tiling Layouts**: Qtile organizes windows in a tiling layout, where they do not overlap and automatically adjust their size and position based on the available space.
    
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Qtile's configuration is done in Python, allowing users to script and customize the window manager according to their preferences.
    
- **Extensible**: The modular nature of Qtile enables users to extend its functionality by writing custom scripts and plugins in Python.
    
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Qtile emphasizes keyboard-based control, making it efficient and fast to navigate and manage windows without relying heavily on a mouse.
    

## Installation

To install Qtile, you typically need to use your system's package manager or build it from source. Qtile can be found in various package repositories and can be installed with commands like:

bashCopy code

`# Example installation using pip pip install qtile`

## Configuration

Qtile's configuration is written in Python and is typically stored in the `~/.config/qtile/config.py` file. In this configuration file, users define layouts, key bindings, startup applications, and other settings.

Here's a simple example of a Qtile configuration:

pythonCopy code

`# Import necessary modules from libqtile import layout, bar, widget  # Define layouts layouts = [     layout.Max(),     layout.MonadTall(),     layout.Stack(num_stacks=2), ]  # Configure widgets for the bar widget_defaults = dict(font='Arial', fontsize=12, padding=3) extension_defaults = widget_defaults.copy()  screens = [     bar.Bar([         widget.GroupBox(),         widget.WindowName(),         widget.Clock(format='%Y-%m-%d %a %I:%M %p'),     ], 24), ]  # Define keybindings keys = [     # Key bindings go here ]  # Qtile config if __name__ == '__main__':     from libqtile import manager     manager.Manager(         # Config options go here     ).loop()`

## Usage

Once Qtile is installed and configured, you can start it by running:

bashCopy code

`qtile start`

You can then use the configured key bindings to navigate and manage your windows effectively within the Qtile tiling window manager.
