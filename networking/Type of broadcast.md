1. **Unicast:** Unicast is a one-to-one communication between a single sender and a single receiver. It's not a broadcast, as the data is sent specifically to one destination.
    
2. **Broadcast:** Broadcast communication is a one-to-all or one-to-many communication where data is sent to all devices on the network segment. This is often used for addressing all devices on a local network.
    
3. **Multicast:** Multicast is a one-to-many communication where data is sent to a selected group of devices. Devices that are part of the multicast group receive the data, while others do not. It's more efficient than broadcast as it targets a specific group rather than all devices.
    
4. **Anycast:** Anycast is a communication method where data is sent to the nearest member in a group of potential receivers. The data is sent to the nearest or best available recipient in the group, improving efficiency and reliability.
    
5. **Geocast:** Geocast is a type of communication where data is sent to a specific geographic area. Devices within that defined geographical region receive the data.
    
6. **Broadcast Domain:** A broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network, where all devices can directly reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. Routers typically define the boundaries of broadcast domains.
