### What is the Internet?  
  
The Internet is an interconnected global network of computers and servers that enables communication, access to information, and much more. To connect to the Internet, it is generally necessary to:  
  
- **An Internet Service Provider (ISP):** An ISP provides the Internet connection, usually via a DSL line, cable connection, optical fiber or wireless (such as 4G or 5G).  
  
- **A Modem or Router:** These devices allow you to connect to the ISP network and create a local network at home.  
  
  
In order for communication to be established between 2 computers connected to the Internet, a few rules are required:  
- Computers must have a different IP address  
- Computers must use the same language (protocols)  
- If the 2 computers belong to different networks then the path made among the networks must be determined (routing rules)  
### What is a Network Protocol?  
  
Network protocols are rules and conventions that govern communication between devices connected to a network. Key protocols include:  
  
- **IP (Internet Protocol):** It allows the routing of data packets over the Internet. IPv4 and IPv6 are common versions.  
  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** It manages the reliable transmission of data, ensuring that it arrives in the right order and without errors.  
  
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** It translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate servers on the Internet.  
  
  
### Organization of Network Information  
  
Information circulating on the Internet is organized into different types of resources:  
	  
- **Web pages:** Websites contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.  
	  
- **Email:** Emails are sent and received via protocols such as SMTP and IMAP.
    
- **Files:** Files of all kinds are shared via protocols like FTP or HTTP.
    
- **Streaming:** Streaming media uses specific protocols for video, music, etc.
    

### Data Packet Traffic

The information is divided into small data packets that travel from sender to recipient via various paths. These packets are routed via switches, routers, and other network devices.

### Role of a DNS Server

A DNS server is essential to the Internet. It translates human-readable domain names (such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) into IP addresses that computers use to locate web servers. It serves as a "directory" of the web.

### Difference between Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer

- **Client-Server Network:** In this model, clients (such as web browsers) request services or resources from servers (websites, databases, etc.). It is centralized and widely used on the Internet.
    
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network:** In this model, the devices are both clients and servers. They share resources directly, which is common in P2P file sharing.
    

### Evolution of Internet Traffic

Internet traffic has evolved considerably over the years in terms of the volume and types of data exchanged. The advent of video streaming, IP telephony, IoT and other technologies has contributed to its rapid growth.

In summary, the Internet is a complex global network that relies on network protocols, DNS servers, and various types of information resources. It offers a variety of communication models, from messaging to file transfers, and has seen its traffic evolve significantly over time.
