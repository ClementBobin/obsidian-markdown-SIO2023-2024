# Wireshark: Network Protocol Analysis and Packet Sniffing Tool

Wireshark is a popular and powerful open-source network protocol analysis tool used for network troubleshooting, analysis, development, and education. In this Markdown document, we'll explore the features, capabilities, and applications of Wireshark.

## What is Wireshark?

Wireshark, formerly known as Ethereal, is a network packet analyzer. It allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. Wireshark can capture data in real-time or analyze pre-recorded packet capture files. It supports a wide range of network protocols and provides detailed information about network activities.

## Key Features of Wireshark

Wireshark offers a wide range of features and capabilities, including:

1. **Live Packet Capture**: Capture and analyze network traffic in real-time on various network interfaces.
    
2. **Display Filters**: Use display filters to focus on specific packets or types of traffic, making it easier to find and analyze relevant data.
    
3. **Packet Decoding**: Wireshark can decode and display the contents of network packets, including headers and payloads, in a human-readable format.
    
4. **Protocol Support**: It supports a vast array of network protocols, including common ones like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and more specialized ones used in industrial automation and IoT.
    
5. **VoIP Analysis**: Wireshark can analyze VoIP (Voice over IP) protocols like SIP and RTP, making it useful for troubleshooting voice and video communication issues.
    
6. **Exporting Data**: You can export captured data to various file formats for further analysis or reporting.
    
7. **Plugin Support**: Extend Wireshark's functionality with plugins for specific tasks or custom protocol analysis.
    

## Use Cases for Wireshark

Wireshark is employed in several scenarios and industries, including:
