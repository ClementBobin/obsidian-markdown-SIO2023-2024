Energy storage is a critical component of modern electrical systems. It allows us to store surplus energy when it's abundant and release it when demand is high. This flexibility is essential for maintaining a stable and reliable power supply. In this document, we'll explore various aspects of energy storage.  
## Why Energy Storage is Necessary  
1. **Load Balancing:** Energy demand varies throughout the day. Energy storage helps balance supply and demand, preventing blackouts during peak usage.  
2. **Renewable Energy Integration:** Solar and wind energy generation are intermittent. Storage allows us to use this energy when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.  
3. **Backup Power:** Energy storage systems act as backup power sources during grid failures.  
4. **Grid Stability:** Energy storage stabilizes voltage and frequency in the electrical grid.  
## Series and Parallel Connections 
### Series Connection 
In a series connection, batteries are connected end-to-end. The total voltage increases, while the capacity (ampere-hours, Ah) remains the same.`

[+] --- Battery 1 --- Battery 2 --- Battery 3 --- [-]

### Parallel Connection 
In a parallel connection, batteries are connected positive to positive and negative to negative. The total capacity increases, while the voltage remains the same.

## Characteristics of Energy Storage Systems  
- **Capacity (C):** The amount of energy an energy storage system can store, measured in ampere-hours (Ah) or watt-hours (Wh).  
- **Voltage (V):** The electrical potential difference across the storage system, measured in volts (V). 
- **Power (P):** The rate at which energy can be delivered or absorbed, measured in watts (W).  
- **Efficiency (Î·):** The ratio of energy output to input, expressed as a percentage.  
## Formulas  
- **Energy (E):** Energy (in watt-hours, Wh) is calculated as the product of voltage (V) and capacity (C):

E = V x C

- **Power (P):** Power (in watts, W) is calculated as the product of voltage (V) and current (I):

P = V x I

## Battery Connections  
Batteries can be connected in various ways to achieve specific voltage and capacity requirements.  
- **Series Connection:** Increases voltage. 
- **Parallel Connection:** Increases capacity.
