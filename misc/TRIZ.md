# TRIZ: Theory of Inventive Problem Solving

TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is a systematic approach to innovation and problem-solving that was developed by Genrich Altshuller. It provides a structured framework for identifying creative solutions to complex problems by analyzing patterns of innovation across various industries and domains.

## Basic Concepts

- **Inventive Principles:** TRIZ defines a set of inventive principles that guide problem-solving by identifying solutions based on patterns observed in patents and innovations. These principles serve as a toolkit for generating innovative ideas.
    
- **Contradictions:** TRIZ recognizes that many problems arise from inherent contradictions, where improving one aspect of a system degrades another. Resolving these contradictions often leads to breakthrough solutions.
    
- **Laws of Evolution:** TRIZ introduces a set of laws that describe the patterns of technological evolution. These laws provide insights into how systems and technologies evolve over time.
    

## Implementation

1. **Problem Identification:** Clearly define the problem you want to solve. Identify the conflicts or contradictions within the problem.
    
2. **Contradiction Analysis:** Determine if the problem is a technical or physical contradiction. Classify the contradictions using the 39 Parameters Contradiction Matrix.
    
3. **Applying Principles:** Use the 40 inventive principles to generate potential solutions to resolve the identified contradictions.
    
4. **Ideation and Evaluation:** Generate multiple ideas using the inventive principles. Evaluate these ideas based on feasibility, effectiveness, and potential impact.
    
5. **Implementation:** Develop and refine the selected solution, considering technical feasibility, resources, and practicality.
    

## Laws of Evolution (1-8)

1. **Law of Completeness of Parts:** As systems evolve, they become more complete, involving more components and functions.
    
2. **Law of Increase of Ideality:** Systems evolve towards higher efficiency, fewer resources, and greater functionality.
    
3. **Law of Transition to Micro-Level:** Evolution involves transitioning from macro-level to micro-level structures.
    
4. **Law of Energy Conductivity:** Systems evolve to facilitate the more efficient flow of energy or substances.
    
5. **Law of Harmful Actions Exclusion:** Evolution seeks to eliminate harmful side effects and unintended consequences.
    
6. **Law of Increasing Dynamism:** Systems evolve to be more dynamic and flexible, enabling adaptation.
    
7. **Law of Transition to a Higher Temporal Dimension:** Evolution involves moving from static to dynamic systems.
    
8. **Law of Transition to a Higher Spatial Dimension:** Evolution leads to systems with increased spatial dimensions.
    

## Contradictions and Prerequisites

TRIZ identifies 39 engineering parameters and uses a matrix to find inventive principles that can resolve contradictions between these parameters. For example, if you need to increase strength while reducing weight, the matrix suggests principles like "Composite Materials" or "Segmentation."

## Principles of Innovation

TRIZ presents 40 principles for inventive problem-solving, such as "Segmentation," "Dynamics," "Copying," "Local Quality," and many more. These principles serve as a source of inspiration when tackling complex problems.

## Examples

- **Problem:** Increase the speed of a vehicle without increasing fuel consumption.
    
    - **Contradiction:** Speed vs. Fuel consumption.
    - **Principle:** Use the "Segregation" principle to separate components that perform conflicting functions.
- **Problem:** Design a quieter vacuum cleaner.
    
    - **Contradiction:** Noise level vs. Suction power.
    - **Principle:** Apply the "Dynamics" principle to create a dynamic balancing mechanism to absorb vibrations.

TRIZ provides a structured and systematic approach to innovation, helping individuals and teams generate inventive solutions to complex problems.
