| 226  | IM Used                            | IM is a specific extension of the HTTP protocol. The extension allows a HTTP server to send diffs (changes) of resources to clients.                                                                                                         |

| 302  | Found                              | This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily                                                                                                                                                     |
| 303  | See Other                          | The server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a GET request.                                                                                                                          |
| 304  | Not Modified                       | It tells the client that the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same cached version of the response.                                                                                                      |

| 402  | Payment Required                   | This response code is reserved for future use. The initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems, however this status code is used very rarely and no standard convention exists.                              |

| 407  | Proxy Authentication Required      | This is similar to 401 Unauthorized but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy.                                                                                                                                                      |

- **424 Failed Dependency:** The method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that other action failed. 
- **425 Too Early:** The server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed. 
- **426 Upgrade Required:** The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol. 
- **428 Precondition Required:** The origin server requires the request to be conditional. 
- **429 Too Many Requests:** The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting"). 
- **431 Request Header Fields Too Large:** The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. 
- **451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons:** The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.

- **501 Not Implemented:** The server does not have the functionality required to fulfill the request. 
- **502 Bad Gateway:** The server, acting as a gateway, received an invalid response from the upstream server. 
- **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance. 
- **504 Gateway Timeout:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or some other auxiliary server it needed to access in order to complete the request. 
- **505 HTTP Version Not Supported:** The server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP that was used in the request message. 
- **506 Variant Also Negotiates:** Transparent content negotiation for the request results in a circular reference. 
- **507 Insufficient Storage:** The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request. 
- **508 Loop Detected:** The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request. 
- **510 Not Extended:** Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it. 
- **511 Network Authentication Required:** The client needs to authenticate to gain network access. 
- **599 Network Connect Timeout Error:** This status code is not specified in any RFCs, but is used by some HTTP proxies to signal a network connect timeout error.

# Introduction to HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol, which is used for transmitting data between a user's web browser and a website. HTTPS is designed to provide a secure and encrypted connection to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged over the internet. It's widely used for online banking, e-commerce, email, and any other sensitive data transmission on the web.

## How HTTPS Works

HTTPS employs a combination of encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure data transfer:

1. **Encryption**: HTTPS uses cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server. This encryption converts the data into a scrambled format, making it unreadable to anyone intercepting the traffic without the proper decryption key.
    
2. **Authentication**: Websites using HTTPS obtain an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This certificate serves as a digital identity for the website and ensures that the user's browser is connecting to the legitimate site and not a malicious imposter.
    
3. **Data Integrity**: HTTPS also includes mechanisms to verify the integrity of the data during transmission. Any tampering or modification of data while in transit will be detected.
    

## Key Components of HTTPS

- **SSL/TLS Certificate**: Websites that use HTTPS have an SSL/TLS certificate issued by a trusted CA. This certificate contains the website's public key and other information and is used to initiate the secure connection.
    
- **Encryption Protocols**: HTTPS relies on encryption protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to secure the data. TLS ensures that the data exchanged between the user and the website remains confidential.
    
- **HTTPS Port**: HTTPS typically uses port 443 for communication, while standard HTTP uses port 80. This helps browsers and servers distinguish between secure and non-secure connections.
    

## Advantages of HTTPS

1. **Data Security**: HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between the user and the website is encrypted, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized parties to intercept and decipher the information.
    
2. **Authentication**: Users can trust that they are connecting to the legitimate website and not a fraudulent one, thanks to the SSL/TLS certificate.
    
3. **Search Engine Ranking**: Search engines, such as Google, prioritize websites using HTTPS in their search results, improving their visibility.
    
4. **Compliance**: Many data protection regulations and standards, like GDPR, require the use of HTTPS to protect user data.
    

## How to Recognize HTTPS

Users can identify HTTPS by looking at the address bar of their web browser. A website using HTTPS will display a padlock icon, and the URL will begin with "https://" instead of "http://". Additionally, modern browsers may indicate "Secure" or display the website's name in green.

## Conclusion

HTTPS is a fundamental technology that ensures the secure and encrypted transmission of data over the internet. It provides data security, authentication, and data integrity, making it essential for protecting sensitive information in online transactions, communication, and interactions with websites.
